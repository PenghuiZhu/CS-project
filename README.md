# UMKC CS Project

Every semester, CS department gets lot of GTA applications, but due to the lack of systematic way of collecting those applications online, their only recourse is to have students email those; thus, flooding someone's inbox.  

<h3>Requirements <span style="font-weight: normal;">(they are flexible and can be subject to modifications)</span>:</h3>

* GTA application submission portal.  
* A web-based application that can collect applications online.

### Nice to have
* A way to filter applicants based on 
  * what courses they took
  * their qualifications (BS, MS, PhD etc.)
  * grades they got in a certain course
  * etc.
* A system to match suitable applicants with open positions.
* CS HR people should be able to assign a status to an application (for example complete vs incomplete) and, based on this status, should be able to reach out to applicant for more information.
* The student should be able to modify an existing application after submission if allowed by the CS HR people. 
* Students can set up conditions within the collection portal.  For instance, if an applicant says, they are not GTA certified, it would be good for the system to only continue to the grader application (and, maybe also, provide a link to obtaining GTA certification). Please see [the GTA application](https://app.box.com/s/hhmkhkeynj878neoa4dbwomvp28229ge) for more information.


### Technical requirements:
Students can pick any platform (programing languages, front end and back-end technologies) to build this application and can choose any database to store data.

For the most part, the application should be programmed by the students.
